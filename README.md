 #  THIS IS THE REVISION OF THE HIGH ODER FUNCTION 
 
  they are three main types in the following summary they are 
  # 1 .FILTER  method
  def: in my own words it is the function or array methods that is used to separates 
  the elements according to the test or a given functions 
  # HOW DOES IT WORKS

  this is the functions that is takes two argments which are the arrays and the test functions 
  so in its local scope we decrelare the new array this array it store the new elements that has score the test 
  so we have to create the codes that pass through all the array and then when if the elements wins the test is authomatically pushed in the array
  and then we returned the passed 
  # feedback and challenges 
   i have seen that if someone ommits to put the return in the functions it provides undifined 
   but for that i want to make shure this become my second nature languages 

#  IMPORTANT 
  this functions is use full for sorting the different things  like the marks of the students if we want to know who passes and the one who failed or to test if someone pays for premium things and things that require sorting things with the different types 

#  2. MAP method
this is the methods that used to add the new things on the current array , the amount of the elements in the array stay the same so this methods takes also two  things:
 1. array : which contain all elements and
 2. transformation method: this is the functiosn that has the ability to changes the any elements of the array 
 # HOW DOES IT WORKS 

  this ths methods takes the two argments as explains anad then this functions inside itsself there is the new array that has created mostly is called mapped and then we loop in that all the array while we are passing through that we apply that transformations and then we send that informations in that new array 

  # feedback and challenges 
   i have faced with the different things the first one is 
   1. error : this was caused that i used the (a,b)=> a+1  but this works only on the array that contains only values and then when the arrays contains the propaties and the thier values we decralare the transformations as this 
   map(array, transformation) then here on the transformation we have to add the (array, element)=>element.proparties name  
   even it was so challenges bit that couese me to learn in good ways 

   # IMPORTANT 
    this is the methods is used to add the new ideas or any things that is need to new array so that it can be easy to do it with using the array and the transformation methods 

    # 3. REDUCE methods

     this is the fantastics methods in the arrays becouse it takes three argments 
     1. array: this is the array we will gets the elements 
     2. combine methods: this is the fucntiosn that is used to combines the array elements and the current situations or the elemts like in the averages we must have the current numbers and the next numbers from the numbers which is needed 
     3. start: this is the current states of the starting examples if someone want to commits the averages he or she can use the redice and the starting he can use the current start as the one 

     # HOW DOES IT WORKS 
     here is how it works it takes three argemts so it uses the combine function, array and the start current so in that functions we have the currents state where we want to make this so at the begining we declare the current valiable and this holds the start value and we loop in the whole array and combining the elements and the current stiuations also this is also equal to that current valiable this will be seen in the parts of the product-rating-analysis 
     then we return the current 
     # FEEDBACK AND THE CHALLENGES

     i have also here faced to forgets that i am using the array with the elements which are the objects and then 
    and then i have collected as i did it in the map funciton

    # important 
    i have learnt this helped me to know more what i sneed to make the obstrtactions and the this helpts to do some culcultaions like the averages and so on
